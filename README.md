# ICDPath

To run ICDPath, you can do it in three different ways:

## 1. Using LangFlow

In this repository, you will see the `ICDPath.json` file, which you have to import into LangFlow. After you do that, you can use it in the LangFlow playground.

## 2. Streamlit App

After you install the requirements, you can run `streamlit_app.py` by using the command:

```bash
streamlit run .\streamlit_app.py
```

## 3. Using LangFlow Python API

If you are more advanced, you can try to play around with the `pythonAPI.py` file, which is the LangFlow API of ICDPath. However, it is not fully optimized.
